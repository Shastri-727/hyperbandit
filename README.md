## Phase 1 ( CURRENT )   
Introduction : Laying the Cornerstone for Production. The initial phase of the HyperBandit project is the most consequential. The architectural decisions and configurations established here form the bedrock upon which the entire platform's stability, scalability, and maintainability will rest. The project vision emphasizes a "production-first mentality," a principle that will guide every action in this foundational stage
This section provides an exhaustive guide to architecting a professional local development environment that mirrors production, establishing rigorous and automated code quality standards, and provisioning a secure, scalable, and fully reproducible cloud infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This meticulous approach is designed to de-risk the project by minimizing deployment friction, preventing configuration drift, and ultimately accelerating the entire development lifecycle from data engineering to model serving.


Conclusion for Phase 1: This phase will established the complete foundational layer for the HyperBandit project. A professional, automated local development environment will be configured to maximize developer velocity while enforcing high code quality standards from the very first commit. The adoption of the Gitflow branching model will provide a structured framework for managing the project's complexity through its lifecycle.Furthermore, the entire cloud infrastructure on GCP will be defined as code using Terraform. This will create a secure, scalable, and reproducible environment, mitigating the risks associated with manual configuration and ensuring a smooth transition from development to production. The strategic selection of managed services like GKE Autopilot, Cloud SQL, and Memorystore aligns with the project's goals of efficiency and operational excellence. With this robust foundation in place, the project will be poised to move into Phase 2: Data Engineering Pipeline, where the focus will shift to building the real-time data processing and feature engineering frameworks.
